# Real Estate Sales Analysis (2001-2020)

A comprehensive statistical analysis of Connecticut real estate sales data exploring sales ratio patterns, property appreciation trends, and spatial distribution of property values.

## Overview

This project analyzes real estate sales data from 2001-2020 using statistical methods and computational approaches to uncover trends in property values, sales patterns, and market behavior across different towns and property types.

**Keywords**: Real Estate Analytics, R Programming, Statistical Analysis, Time Series Analysis, Spatial Analysis, Data Visualization, Property Valuation

## Key Features

- Time series analysis of sales ratios
- Spatial pattern detection in property values
- Property type appreciation analysis
- Statistical modeling and visualization
- Correlation analysis of market factors
- Trend detection and forecasting
