# Fake News Detection using Machine Learning

A machine learning project to classify news articles as real or fake using various text classification algorithms.

## Introduction

This project aims to develop a robust fake news detection system using machine learning techniques. It utilizes natural language processing and various classification algorithms to distinguish between genuine and fabricated news articles.

**Keywords**: Fake News Detection, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Text Classification, Data Mining

## User Instructions

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ajaychary06/Projects.git
   cd Projects/Data-Mining/final-project.ipnyb
   ```
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn nltk matplotlib seaborn
   ```
3. Download NLTK data:
   ```python
   import nltk
   nltk.download('stopwords')
   nltk.download('wordnet')
   ```

## Developer Instructions

### Building and Running the Project

1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
2. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended).
3. Install dependencies as mentioned in the User Instructions.
4. Place your dataset files (train.csv, test.csv, submit.csv) in the project directory.
5. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script to execute the project.

## Methodologies

- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, tokenization, lemmatization, and removing stopwords
- Feature Extraction: TF-IDF vectorization
- Machine Learning Models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - Naive Bayes
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting

## Results and Expectations

The project aims to achieve high accuracy in classifying news articles as real or fake. Expected outcomes include:

- Comparison of different machine learning models' performance
- Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Insights into the most effective features for fake news detection
